I'll explain the code step by step, going through each section:

### Imports and Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

np.random.seed(42)
```

- Imports NumPy for numerical operations and arrays
- Imports Matplotlib for creating plots and visualizations
- Imports FuncAnimation specifically for creating animations
- Sets a random seed (42) to ensure reproducibility of random numbers

### TwoNeuronSystem Class Initialization

```python
class TwoNeuronSystem:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, initial_weight=0.2):
        self.weight = initial_weight
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        
        self.weight_history = [initial_weight]
        self.activity_correlation_history = []
```

- Defines a class to encapsulate the two-neuron system
- `__init__` is the constructor that initializes the class when an object is created
- Sets the initial connection weight between neurons to the provided value (default 0.2)
- Sets the learning rate that controls how quickly weights change (default 0.01)
- Creates a list to track weight changes over time, starting with the initial weight
- Creates an empty list to track correlation between neuron activities

### The Simulate Method

```python
def simulate(self, num_timesteps=1000, correlation=0.8):
```
- Defines a method to run the simulation
- Takes parameters for number of time steps and desired correlation between neurons

```python
    neuron1_activities = np.zeros(num_timesteps)
    neuron2_activities = np.zeros(num_timesteps)
```
- Creates arrays to store the activity values of both neurons at each time step
- Initializes them with zeros

```python
    mean = [0, 0]
    cov = [[1, correlation], [correlation, 1]]
    activities = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, num_timesteps)
```
- Sets up parameters for generating correlated random activities
- `mean = [0, 0]` specifies that both neurons have a mean activity of 0
- `cov` is the covariance matrix that determines the correlation:
  - Diagonal values (1) represent variance of each neuron
  - Off-diagonal values (correlation) control how coordinated the neurons are
- Generates random values from a multivariate normal distribution with specified correlation

```python
    neuron1_activities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-activities[:, 0]))
    neuron2_activities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-activities[:, 1]))
```
- Applies sigmoid function to transform the random values into activity levels between 0 and 1
- `activities[:, 0]` accesses the first column (neuron 1's raw activities)
- `activities[:, 1]` accesses the second column (neuron 2's raw activities)

```python
    for t in range(num_timesteps):
        a1 = neuron1_activities[t]
        a2 = neuron2_activities[t]
```
- Loops through each time step
- Gets the current activity values for both neurons

```python
        if t > 0:
            recent_corr = np.corrcoef(neuron1_activities[max(0, t-100):t+1], 
                                     neuron2_activities[max(0, t-100):t+1])[0, 1]
            self.activity_correlation_history.append(recent_corr)
```
- Calculates the correlation coefficient between neuron activities over the recent time window (up to 100 steps)
- `np.corrcoef` returns a 2×2 correlation matrix; [0, 1] extracts the correlation between the two variables
- Stores this correlation value in the history list
- Only does this after the first step (if t > 0)

```python
        delta_w = self.learning_rate * a1 * a2
        self.weight += delta_w
```
- This is the key Hebbian learning rule: "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
- `delta_w` is the change in weight, proportional to:
  - The learning rate (how quickly weights change)
  - The product of both neurons' activities (when both are active, weight increases)
- Updates the connection weight by adding this change

```python
        self.weight = np.clip(self.weight, 0, 2)
```
- Prevents the weight from growing without bounds or becoming negative
- Constrains the weight value between 0 and 2

```python
        self.weight_history.append(self.weight)
```
- Records the updated weight for later analysis and visualization

```python
    return neuron1_activities, neuron2_activities
```
- Returns the complete activity patterns of both neurons for the entire simulation

### The Plot Results Method

```python
def plot_results(self):
    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 12))
```
- Creates a figure with 3 subplots stacked vertically
- Sets the figure size to 10×12 inches

```python
    ax1.plot(self.weight_history, 'b-')
    ax1.set_title('Connection Weight Evolution')
    ax1.set_xlabel('Time Step')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Weight')
    ax1.grid(True)
```
- First subplot: shows how connection weight changes over time
- Plots weight_history as a blue line
- Sets appropriate title and axis labels
- Adds a grid for better readability

```python
    ax2.plot(self.activity_correlation_history, 'r-')
    ax2.set_title('Activity Correlation')
    ax2.set_xlabel('Time Step')
    ax2.set_ylabel('Correlation')
    ax2.set_ylim(-1.1, 1.1)
    ax2.grid(True)
```
- Second subplot: shows how correlation between neuron activities changes over time
- Plots activity_correlation_history as a red line
- Sets y-axis limits between -1.1 and 1.1 (correlation ranges from -1 to 1)

```python
    ax3.axis('off')
    ax3.set_title('Two-Neuron System')
    circle1 = plt.Circle((0.3, 0.5), 0.2, color='lightblue', alpha=0.7)
    circle2 = plt.Circle((0.7, 0.5), 0.2, color='lightblue', alpha=0.7)
    ax3.add_patch(circle1)
    ax3.add_patch(circle2)
```
- Third subplot: visual representation of the two neurons
- Turns off axes (no coordinate system needed)
- Creates two circles to represent the neurons at positions (0.3, 0.5) and (0.7, 0.5)
- Makes them light blue with slight transparency (alpha=0.7)
- Adds these circles to the plot

```python
    arrow_width = self.weight_history[-1] * 0.05
    arrow = ax3.arrow(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, head_width=0.05, 
                      head_length=0.05, fc='black', ec='black',
                      width=arrow_width)
```
- Creates an arrow representing the connection between neurons
- Width of the arrow scales with the final connection weight
- Sets various arrow properties like head width/length and colors

```python
    ax3.text(0.3, 0.5, 'N1', ha='center', va='center')
    ax3.text(0.7, 0.5, 'N2', ha='center', va='center')
    ax3.text(0.5, 0.7, f'w = {self.weight_history[-1]:.2f}', ha='center')
```
- Adds text labels to identify neurons ('N1' and 'N2')
- Adds text showing the final connection weight value

```python
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```
- Adjusts subplot spacing for better appearance
- Displays the complete figure

### The Visualization Method

```python
def visualize_dynamic_system(self):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
    ax.set_xlim(0, 1)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 1)
    ax.axis('off')
    ax.set_title('Two-Neuron System with Changing Connection Strength')
```
- Creates a new figure for the animation
- Sets axis limits and turns off coordinate display
- Sets a title for the animation

```python
    circle1 = plt.Circle((0.3, 0.5), 0.2, color='lightblue', alpha=0.7)
    circle2 = plt.Circle((0.7, 0.5), 0.2, color='lightblue', alpha=0.7)
    ax.add_patch(circle1)
    ax.add_patch(circle2)
    
    ax.text(0.3, 0.5, 'N1', ha='center', va='center')
    ax.text(0.7, 0.5, 'N2', ha='center', va='center')
```
- Creates and adds circles for both neurons, similar to the static plot
- Adds text labels for each neuron

```python
    weight_text = ax.text(0.5, 0.8, f'Weight: {self.weight_history[0]:.2f}', ha='center')
    step_text = ax.text(0.5, 0.9, f'Step: 0', ha='center')
```
- Creates text objects to display the current weight and time step
- These will be updated in the animation

```python
    arrow = ax.arrow(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, head_width=0.05, 
                     head_length=0.05, fc='black', ec='black',
                     width=self.weight_history[0] * 0.05)
```
- Creates an initial arrow representing the connection

```python
    def update(frame):
        weight_text.set_text(f'Weight: {self.weight_history[frame]:.2f}')
        step_text.set_text(f'Step: {frame}')
        
        if 'arrow' in locals():
            arrow.remove()
        
        arrow_width = self.weight_history[frame] * 0.05
        new_arrow = ax.arrow(0.4, 0.5, 0.2, 0, head_width=0.05, 
                          head_length=0.05, fc='black', ec='black',
                          width=arrow_width)
        
        return weight_text, step_text, new_arrow
```
- Defines a function that updates the animation for each frame
- Updates the text displaying current weight and step
- Removes the previous arrow and creates a new one with width proportional to current weight
- Returns the updated elements to be redrawn

```python
    ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=range(0, len(self.weight_history), 10),
                        blit=True, repeat=False)
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```
- Creates the animation using the update function
- Only uses every 10th frame to improve performance (`range(0, len(self.weight_history), 10)`)
- `blit=True` optimizes the animation by only redrawing changed parts
- Shows the animation

### The Demonstration Function

```python
def run_demonstration():
    print("Simulation 1: Positively Correlated Neurons")
    positive_sys = TwoNeuronSystem(learning_rate=0.01, initial_weight=0.2)
    positive_sys.simulate(num_timesteps=1000, correlation=0.8)
    positive_sys.plot_results()
```
- Creates a TwoNeuronSystem instance for positively correlated neurons (0.8)
- Runs the simulation for 1000 time steps
- Plots the results

```python
    print("\nSimulation 2: Uncorrelated Neurons")
    uncorrelated_sys = TwoNeuronSystem(learning_rate=0.01, initial_weight=0.2)
    uncorrelated_sys.simulate(num_timesteps=1000, correlation=0.0)
    uncorrelated_sys.plot_results()
```
- Creates a second system with uncorrelated neurons (0.0)
- Runs the simulation and plots results

```python
    print("\nSimulation 3: Negatively Correlated Neurons")
    negative_sys = TwoNeuronSystem(learning_rate=0.01, initial_weight=0.2)
    negative_sys.simulate(num_timesteps=1000, correlation=-0.8)
    negative_sys.plot_results()
    
    return positive_sys, uncorrelated_sys, negative_sys
```
- Creates a third system with negatively correlated neurons (-0.8)
- Runs the simulation and plots results
- Returns all three system objects for potential further use

### Main Execution Block

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    positive_sys, uncorrelated_sys, negative_sys = run_demonstration()
    
    # Optional: Show animation for positive correlation
    positive_sys.visualize_dynamic_system()
```
- Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported)
- Runs the demonstration function to create all three simulations
- Displays the animation for the positive correlation scenario

This completes the line-by-line explanation of the code. Is there any specific part you'd like me to explain in more depth?
